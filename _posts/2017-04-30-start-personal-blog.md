During this long week-end, I'll start to write some blog posts
about project ideas that I had in mind.
I do this in order to document them so that I can point people
to them when discussing about the project around me.
And also to be a mean to engage more people in them.

I plan to publish a blog post about the project to build a
corpus for malagasy language and the approach I propose to
do it.

After that -if I have enough time and energy- I'll write about
the BetaX community project that I have in mind for a while.

Feedback are welcome. My contact can be found on my github account.

P.S. I'm just starting using Jekyll so be tolerant about the bugs
that I'll make :)
