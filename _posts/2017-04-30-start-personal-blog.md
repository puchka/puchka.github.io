For this long week-end, I'll start to write some blog pots
about project ideas that I had in mind.
I do this for documenting them so that I can point people
to them when discussing about the project.
And also to be a mean to engage more people in them.

I plan to publish a blog post about the project to build a
corpora for malagasy language and the approach I propose to
do it.

After, if I have enough time and energy, I'll write about
the project BetaX community that I have in mind for some times
now.

Feedback are welcome. My contact can be found on my github account.

P.S. I'm just starting using Jekyll so be tolerant about the bugs
that I'll make :)
