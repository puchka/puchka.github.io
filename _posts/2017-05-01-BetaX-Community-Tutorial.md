Here are some screeshots provided by [Tsiry Sandratraina](https://github.com/realtsiry)
for using the scripts I provided earlier.

First, open [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/dir///@-18.9295443,47.5036429,13z)
in a Browser and go to the view of the bus stop where the bus line start.

Click on the Input for the Start Position and then click on the related position
in the Map. You can refine it by dragging the point in the Map.

![ ]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/capture_1.png "Start Position")

Repeat for the following way points.

![ ]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/capture_2.png "First way point")

![ ]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/capture_3.png "Second way point")

![ ]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/capture_4.png "Third way point")

![ ]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/capture_5.png "4th way point")

![ ]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/capture_6.png "5th way point")

Copy the URL in the address bar of the Browser to a text file.

![ ]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/capture_7.png "Copy URL")

Use the command line toolchain previously released which can be found
here : [BetaX Community](https://github.com/puchka/BetaX-Community)

![ ]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/capture_8.png "Command line")

Open the generated .html file which will display the route in a Map.

![ ]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/capture_9.png "Result in a Map")

Last but not least, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)
the repo of [BetaX community](https://github.com/puchka/BetaX-Community) and send a pull request ;)
